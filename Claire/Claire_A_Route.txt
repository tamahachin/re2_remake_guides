• MAINTANANCE TUNNEL
	- Grab the large powder off the back table and go back up the ladder to the Greenhouse

• GREENHOUSE
	- On the way back to the Greenhouse Control Room, grab the R on the floor by the covered walkway

• GREENHOUSE CONTROL ROOM
	- Use the cartridge in the dispensing machine and return to Greenhouse

• GREENHOUSE
	- Go straight forward down the middle walkway and grab the B in the back to combine with the R you picked up
		- You can flame round the Ivy's if you want or use your safety knife to escape their grabs when you leave
	- Grab and combine the wristband chip then return to Greenhouse Control Room

• GREENHOUSE CONTROL ROOM
	- Go left around the counter to avoid the Ivy to your right when you enter the door

• GREENHOUSE CONTROL ROOM → P-4 LEVEL TESTING LAB
	- Grab everything you see on the way, there are no more enemies
	- You can dump your stuff in the Lobby Save Room first if you'd like

< ------------------------------------------------------------- BOSS FIGHTS >

• P-4 LEVEL TESTING LAB
	- Grab everything and save #3
	- You can set up your inventory based on preference, but you must have the wristband
		- This is the time to use all the resources you've collected and do whatever you want

• G3
	- G3 can be perma-stunned if you use acid rounds
		- If you haven't used any powders so far, you should have enough to make 20+ acid rounds
		- You have to hit him with the acid round when he is walking normally, not while he is standing still from the stun animation
		- It is recommended to carry some backup weapons as the acid rounds may not be enough
		- Bring some full RGB heals just in case
	- After the fight, grab everything from the arena and head to Main Shaft → down Elevator → Explosion Gauntlet

• EXPLOSION GAUNTLET
	- Pick up items on the way to the item box in the Escape Shaft Platform
	- Set up your inventory: Reloaded pistol, Grenade Launcher, flame rounds
	- When you go down the small lift, begin running
		- 3 Ivy's will get up but just run around them, giving them as much room as you can and you won't get grabbed
	- While waiting for Sherry to unlock the door, flame round and kill the 2 Ivy's that drop down from the ceiling
	- You will meet a zombie on fire, just shoot it once and it'll fall

• TRAIN TURNTABLE
	- Set up your inventory: Leaving 2 spaces for the joint plug, fill your inventory with whatever
		- I recommend all your grenades, back up pistol with ammo, a couple full heals just in case (you probably won't need them)
	- Grab the joint plug from the train and place it in the Turntable Control Room, then grab the minigun

• G4
	- Killing G4 is based on how many eyes you pop, not how much damage you do
	- You can kill it with only the minigun if you shoot very carefully and only at the eyes
	- Throwing grenades at it is very effective in popping many eyes at once
	- Stay at the far ends of the train so when he does his charge attack, you can simply go around the corner to dodge
	- When he is crawling on the ground and gushing...things, he's technically dead and will time out after a few seconds
