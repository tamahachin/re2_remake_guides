	- Grab everything and save #3
	- You can set up your inventory based on preference, but you must have the wristband
		- This is the time to use all the resources you've collected and do whatever you want

• G3
	- G3 can be perma-stunned if you use acid rounds
		- If you haven't used any powders so far, you should have enough to make 20+ acid rounds
		- You have to hit him with the acid round when he is walking normally, not while he is standing still from the stun animation
		- It is recommended to carry some backup weapons as the acid rounds may not be enough
		- Bring some full RGB heals just in case
	- After the fight, grab everything from the arena and head to Main Shaft → down Elevator → Explosion Gauntlet

• EXPLOSION GAUNTLET
	- Pick up items on the way to the item box in the Escape Shaft Platform
	- Set up your inventory: Pistol, Grenade Launcher, flame rounds
	- When you go down the small lift, begin running
		- 3 Ivy's will get up but just run around them, giving them as much room as you can and you won't get grabbed
	- While waiting for Sherry to unlock the door, flame round and kill the 2 Ivy's that drop down from the ceiling
	- You will meet a zombie on fire, just shoot it once and it'll fall

• TRAIN TURNTABLE
	- Set up your inventory: Leaving 2 spaces for the joint plug, fill your inventory with whatever
		- I personally grab the SMG, all my grenades, back up pistol, and heals
	- Grab the joint plug from the train and place it in the Turntable Control Room, then grab the minigun
• G4
	- Killing G4 is based on how many eyes you pop, not how much damage you do
	- You can kill it with only the minigun if you shoot very carefully and only at the eyes
	- Throwing grenades at it is very effective in popping many eyes at once
	- Stay at the far ends of the train so when he does his charge attack, you can simply go around the corner to dodge
	- When he is crawling on the ground and gushing...things, save your ammo and stop shooting, he will time out

• G5
	- Bring anything
		- I personally use my leftover minigun, modded SLS60 as a magnum, pistol just in case
	- Run forward to start the fight and have it come through the door, and back up all the way
	- Don't shoot it until it opens the center eye completely, then unload and kill
