# Resident Evil 2 Remake Guides

All guides are written with hardcore difficulty in mind. Assisted and standard providing 3 easy hip pouch pick ups gives room to grab extra resources if you need them.

These are not speedrun guides, but they should get you S+ time. Around 2hr for A runs, 1hr45m for B runs. 

The only "speed-tech" I use is stair skating, where you tap aim while on stairs every second or so to cancel the stair climbing animation. Not sure how much of a difference that really makes outside of speedrunning, but I feel faster. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
